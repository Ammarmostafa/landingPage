# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in it.

I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.

I made a button to create additional sections.

I made an icon to go to the top of the page smoothly and appear after scaling to 850 pixels.

I made the link header disappear after 10 seconds and reappear with just a scroll.
